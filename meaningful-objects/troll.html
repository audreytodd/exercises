        <p>This is a picture of my troll doll with pink hair. It's meaningful to me because it was my moms from the 70s. I got it when we visited my grandparents house in like 2011 and I've put it in my bedroom since. In my room in Denver it hung on the wall and in my room here I keep it on my dresser. Ever since I got this troll I've loved finding them whenever I go to estate sales, antique stores, and that kind of stuff. </p>
