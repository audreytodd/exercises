        <p>This is a picture of my JVC discman from 1999. I found it at a garage sale this summer and now I use it almost everyday to listen to music. I just think CDs themselves are so cool! I love the detail that goes into the art for the case and the disc itself. Since I got this discman I have also had so much fun finding my favorite albums on CD.</p>
