        <p>This is a picture of my dad from when he first moved to Colorado for college. I keep this picture on my nightstand and it's important to me because it makes me feel closer to him and it serves as a reminder of his role in who I am, as well as the role that growing up and living in Colorado played in making me who I am.</p>
