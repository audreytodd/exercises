        <p>This is an image of a bird skull in resin. It is special to me because in eighth grade when I was coming home from school I saw this skull laying in the dirt by my backdoor. I was fascinated by how perfectly intact it was so I picked it up and kept it until a couple days later when my mom helped me to preserve it in resin. This is another object that I always put in my room.</p>
