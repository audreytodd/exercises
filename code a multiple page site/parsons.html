    <p>Parsons School of Design, known colloquially as Parsons, is a private art and design college located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. Founded in 1896 after a group of progressive artists broke away from established Manhattan art academies in protest of limited creative autonomy, Parsons is one of the oldest schools of art and design in New York.[1]</p>
    <p>Parsons was the first school to offer programs in fashion design, interior design, advertising, graphic design, and lighting design.[1] Parsons became the first American school to found a satellite school abroad when it established the Paris Ateliers in 1921.[7] It remains the first and only private art and design school to affiliate with a private national research university, in 1970 when it became one of the divisions of The New School.[8] Organized in five departments, the school offers undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of disciplines in art and design with students also able to combine additional classes and majors in other colleges of The New School.[9]</p>
